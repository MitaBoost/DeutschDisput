# **App Name**: DeutschDisput

## Core Features:

- Topic Selection: Allow users to select from a list of common discussion topics in German.
- Argument Generation: Generate ten advantages and ten disadvantages for the selected topic, tailored to A1, A2, B1, and B2 CEFR levels using generative AI. This tool makes sure all sentences are grammatically correct and contextually relevant.
- Argument Display: Display the generated arguments in a clear, sectioned format, with separate sections for each CEFR level (A1, A2, B1, B2). Each section should have a clear division between 'Vorteile' (advantages) and 'Nachteile' (disadvantages).
- Grammar Accuracy: Provide example sentences that include subordinate clauses and connector words (weil, obwohl, damit, wenn, dass, während, um...zu, sodass, falls), modal verbs, and correct verb placement based on the selected CEFR level.
- Level Switching: Provide a toggle to switch between CEFR levels, allowing the user to view arguments appropriate for their current German proficiency. The selected CEFR level should persist across different topics.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A light, warm grey (#F0F0F0) for readability and a clean interface.
- Secondary color: A muted blue (#64B5F6) to indicate interactive elements and section headers.
- Accent: A bright teal (#26A69A) for highlighting active states or important information.
- Use a clear, sectioned layout to separate topics and CEFR levels. The selected CEFR level should be prominently displayed.
- Use simple, intuitive icons to represent different discussion topics.
- Subtle transitions when switching between CEFR levels or displaying new arguments.

## Original User Request:
Create an app or AI tool that helps German learners practice writing and understanding arguments. The tool should allow users to select from a list of common discussion topics (see list below), and then automatically generate ten advantages and ten disadvantages for each topic at four CEFR language levels: A1, A2, B1, and B2.

Each level should reflect the grammar and vocabulary appropriate for that level:

A1 Level: 10 advantages and 10 disadvantages written in simple main clauses using basic vocabulary.

A2 Level: 10 advantages and 10 disadvantages written in simple sentences using connectors like weil, aber, denn.

B1 Level: 10 advantages and 10 disadvantages including subordinate clauses, such as relative clauses and connectors like obwohl, damit, wenn.

B2 Level: 10 advantages and 10 disadvantages with complex sentence structures, including passive voice, subjunctive (Konjunktiv II), and infinitive clauses (um...zu), where suitable.

Each topic should be processed so that the app displays four sections for each proficiency level. Each section should contain 10 advantage sentences and 10 disadvantage sentences, written with the grammar complexity required for the level.

All example sentences should be realistic, meaningful, and follow standard German grammar rules. Where applicable, the sentences should include subordinate clauses and connector words like:

weil, obwohl, damit, wenn, dass, während, um...zu, sodass, falls

Use modal verbs and verb-second/verb-final placement according to the rules of German sentence structure.
